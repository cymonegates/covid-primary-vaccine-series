# Determining COVID-19 Vaccine Primary Series Completion

# Overview
Determining when a person has completed their COVID-19 primary vaccine series is necessary for public health departments to accurately count how many people are fully vaccinated and how many vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 cases are occurring. This SAS macro program does just that. 

Primary Series Definition:

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7050e2.htm
"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines primary series completion as 2 vaccine doses for persons who received Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or unspecified U.S.-authorized or approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, or receipt of 1 dose for persons who received Janssen. Persons who received a different mRNA vaccine product for the first and second dose would be represented under the vaccine product administered for the second dose."

"Individuals who receive the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine no more than 4 days before (referred to as the “grace period”) or at any time after the recommended second dose date are considered to have completed the primary series."

# Notes and Considerations
The calculations in this SAS program use the definition of primary series completion as it was in January 2022. It may be subject to change by the CDC and updates will not be reflected here but can be easily updated.
