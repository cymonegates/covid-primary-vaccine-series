# Determining COVID-19 Vaccine Series Completion

# Overview
Determining when a person has completed their COVID-19 primary vaccine series is necessary for public health departments to, not only, accurately share how many people are fully vaccinated but is also necessary for counting how many vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 cases are occurring. This SAS macro program does just that. 

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines primary series completion as 2 vaccine doses for persons who received Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or unspecified U.S.-authorized or approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, or receipt of 1 dose for persons who received Janssen. Primary series vaccine product is defined by the vaccine administered as the first dose for 1-dose series and the second dose for 2-dose series. Persons who received a different mRNA vaccine product for the first and second dose would be represented under the vaccine product administered for the second dose. All results were limited to only persons who had received Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen, and unspecified U.S.-authorized or approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine; recipients who received other vaccine products are not included. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7050e2.htm

# Notes and Considerations
The calculations in this SAS program use the definition of primary series completion as it was in January 2022. It may be subject to change by the CDC and updates will not be reflected here but can be easily updated.
